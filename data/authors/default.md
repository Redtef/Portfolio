I am a software engineer who values learning and growing with people, teams, and technologies. Experienced at designing and building systems from scratch based on clients requirements and handling and upgrading old codebases.

My experiences in both startups and established company helped widen my skills and my ability to pick up new technologies in a relatively short time.

I also dedicate a substantial amount of times to Web3 technologies.
